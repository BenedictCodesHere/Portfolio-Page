# Portfolio-Page
Building a portfolio page

## Description

This project is designed as a portfolio, with a bio, links to my projects, and ways to contact me, utilising the HTML and CSS skills (Flexbox, media queries, variables) I have in the design of the page itself.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The way to use the webpage is to hover over/click on the relevant links, and also to view the webpage on different devices to see how the page layout changes in response to screen-size constraints.
The navigation bar at the top of the page is interactive, so clicking the relevant phrases will take you to the area of the page that they correspond to.
